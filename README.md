# Image Stitching with OpenCV

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to download image assets, load them using OpenCV, and stitch them together to create a panorama using OpenCV's Stitcher module. The images are extracted from a ZIP file, processed, and then displayed using Matplotlib.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the script:
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy (numpy)
- Matplotlib (matplotlib)
